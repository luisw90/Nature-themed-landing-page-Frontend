This was built in a day for a Hack-Day event. It uses Create React App, in Typescript. Images are animated with Three.js. 
the project includes nature facts, images and sounds which are fetched with an api. The backend was made ExpressJS and MongoDB and can be found in a separate repository.

## 'Concept'

Each time you visit the site, you'll be presented with unique and stunning animated images, sounds and fascinating facts about the natural world. So come on in and take a spin, and let the wonders of the natural world surprise and delight you!

## `Thoughts`

This project was a great way for me to combine react and three.js. 
Looking forward to create more interesting projects similar to this!
